# stock-price-prediction-using-yFinance

This project focuses on predicting stock prices using historical data fetched through the yfinance library. It employs time series analysis and machine learning techniques, specifically LSTMs, to provide reliable predictions of future stock prices.

# Features

Data Acquisition: Automatically fetch historical stock data using the yfinance library.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data using Python libraries like pandas and numpy.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize stock trends and patterns using matplotlib and seaborn.

Modeling: Build and train LSTM models using TensorFlow/Keras for time series forecasting.

Prediction: Generate and visualize future stock price predictions.

# Technologies and Tools
